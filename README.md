# Sudoku-Plus
A Python GUI based game made with Tkinter. 
Incorporates a fast-solving algorithm and a visualization algorithm.
The fast-solving algorithm incorporates a back-tracking algorithm to efficiently find the solutions to Sudoku puzzles. This algorithm explores possible numbers for each cell, backtracking when a conflict arises, until a valid solution is found.
The recursive visualization algorithm that visually demonstrates the backtracking steps, enabling players to learn and understand the Sudoku-solving techniques.
The game was created using the Python programming language and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. The Sudoku grid is represented as a 2D array, and the user can interact with the grid through the Tkinter Entry widgets.
